# Neural Network from Scratch

## Setup
Run the following command to install the neuralnetwork package (consider using a virtual environment):

```bash
$ pip install .
```

If you want to run the MNIST and Boston housing examples you need additional packages:

```bash
$ pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
```
